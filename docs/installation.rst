Stable release
--------------

To install taggo, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install taggo

If you also want to download the required packages to run all metadata-addons, install taggo like this.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install taggo[all]

This is the preferred method to install taggo, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.
